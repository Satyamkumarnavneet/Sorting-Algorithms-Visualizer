# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer project aims to develop a responsive web platform that visually represents various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. The platform will feature a box or bar graph displaying unsorted data that users can sort using different algorithms.
